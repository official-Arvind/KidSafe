1. **Go to your GitHub repository:** https://github.com/official-Arvind/KidSafe
2. **Click "Releases"** in the right sidebar
3. **Click "Create a new release"**
4. **Choose a tag:** `v1.0.0` (already created)
5. **Add title:** "Dash App v1.0.0"
6. **Add description:**
   ```
   ## Dash App v1.0.0

## Method 2: Trigger via Push (Alternative)

The workflow also triggers on pushes to main branch. You can make a small change:

```bash
# Add a small change
echo "# Build triggered on $(date)" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Trigger build"
git push origin main
```

## Method 3: Manual Workflow Trigger

1. Go to your repository
2. Click "Actions" tab
3. Click "Android CI/CD" workflow
4. Click "Run workflow"
5. Choose branch: `main`
6. Click "Run workflow"

## 📱 What Happens After Triggering:

1. **Build Job Starts:**
   - Sets up Java 17 and Android SDK
   - Downloads dependencies
   - Generates keystore
   - Builds debug and release APKs
   - Signs the release APK

2. **Release Job (if creating release):**
   - Downloads the release APK
   - Attaches it to the GitHub release
   - Makes it available for download

3. **You Get:**
   - ✅ Signed release APK
   - ✅ Debug APK for testing
   - ✅ Build artifacts
   - ✅ Installation instructions

## 🔍 Monitor the Build:

1. Go to "Actions" tab in your repository
2. Click on the running workflow
3. Watch the build progress in real-time
4. Download APKs when complete

## ⏱️ Expected Build Time:

- **First build:** 5-10 minutes (downloads dependencies)
- **Subsequent builds:** 3-5 minutes (uses cache)

## 🎯 Next Steps:

1. **Trigger the workflow** using one of the methods above
2. **Monitor the build** in the Actions tab
3. **Download the APK** when build completes
4. **Test the app** on your device
5. **Share the release** with others
